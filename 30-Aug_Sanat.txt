What is Data?
What is Big Data?
4 V's of Big Data - Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity
Batch and Stream Data Processing.
Extract, Load, Transform(ETL) Pipelines
How to process Big Data?
Parallel Processing and Distributive Computing
Hadoop used for Batch Processing & PySpark used for Stream Processing.
Structured, Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data
Data Warehouse -
Save data as object
Tables
Views
Structured data (Fixed Schema-data allocated even if value is null)
Dimension Modelling
ACID Property in DBMS -
Atomicity
Consistency
Isolation
Durability
Datalake -
Saves all types of data (Structured, Semi-Structured and Unstructured)
Flexible Schema (No data allocated for null values)
No ACID properties
Data Lakehouse
Combination of Data warehouse and Datalake.
Took advantages of both Data warehouse and Datalake.
Difference :

 

	

Data Warehouse

	

Data Lake

	

Data Lakehouse




Storage Data Type

	

Works well with structured data

	

Works well with semi-structured and unstructured data

	

Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data




Purpose

	

Optimal for data analytics and business intelligence (BI) use-cases

	

Suitable for machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) workloads

	

Suitable for both data analytics and machine learning workloads




Cost

	

Storage is costly and time-consuming

	

Storage is cost-effective, fast, and flexible

	

Storage is cost-effective, fast, and flexible




ACID Compliance

	

Records data in an ACID-compliant manner to ensure the highest levels of integrity

	

Non-ACID compliance: updates and deletes are complex operations

	

ACID-compliant to ensure consistency as multiple parties concurrently read or write data
